# Driver Compliance with the Recommended Route in the Context of Last-Mile Delivery

As the popularity of online shopping keeps growing, last-mile delivery has evolved into a crucial stage in the supply chain process. The effectiveness of this final step significantly depends on the performance of delivery drivers. Despite improvements in last-mile delivery solutions employing route optimization algorithms, the real-world application of these models is still challenging due to not considering many real-life constraints. We study the factors behind these discrepancies by analyzing drivers' compliance behaviour with the recommended optimized path in actual last-mile delivery operations carried out from two warehouses located in Lisbon and Barcelona. Building logistic regression models gives us the findings that larger time window durations and unfamiliarity with locations in the routes increase drivers' compliance. Conversely, busy roads, densely populated areas, and a variety of retailers' products on the routes have a negative impact on compliance. We also build three different classification models to predict whether a driver will follow a delivery stop in the suggested sequence order or not in the undirected case, and find that the random forest classifier outperforms the others.
